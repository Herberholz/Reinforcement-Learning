# Reinforcement-Learning

Environment: Robby the Robot lives in a 10 x 10 grid, surrounded by a wall. Some of the grid squares contain soda cans.

Write a simulator for Robby the Robot in which he receives sensor input, can perform actions, and receives rewards. Write a Q-learning method for Robby, using a Q-matrix, in which the rows correspond to states and the columns correspond to actions. The Q-matrix is initialized to all zeros at the beginning of a run.
